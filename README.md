## Project Overview

When dealing with **small datasets**, machine learning models often struggle to generalize well, leading to **overfitting**. This happens when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data. In this project, weâ€™ll work with a **Sequential model** that achieves **95% accuracy** on the training set but only **75% validation accuracy**, indicating overfitting.

Weâ€™ll apply several techniques, such as **regularization** and **data augmentation**, to help the model generalize better. The goal is to retain high accuracy on unseen data while reducing overfitting.

### Key Features:

- ðŸ§  **Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in the model.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation to artificially increase the size of the dataset.
- ðŸ”§ **Overfitting Reduction**: Explore strategies like dropout and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Model Optimization**: Retain high accuracy on validation data by tuning the model with the new techniques.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main language for implementing the project.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and fine-tuning the Sequential model.
- **Keras**: To apply regularization and data augmentation techniques within the TensorFlow environment.
